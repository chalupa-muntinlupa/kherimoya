# kherimoya - server management thing for Endstone
</div>

## introduction
Kherimoya *(right now)* does not do much. For now, Kherimoya only sets up a "kherimoya" environment that is just a folder set up with Endstone.

Kherimoya is very early in its development, and right now is only good for managing multiple servers, and right now isn't very good compared to just using Endstone.

## kheremara projects
Kheremara is an umbrella identity used for things like plugins *(just plugins right now)* that utilize Kherimoya's features like its file structure

## planned features
The following features **WILL** be included in Kherimoya in the future.
<ul>
    <li>Kherimoya endstone plugin, that can do things like tell the status of the server and communicate with Kherimoya
    <li>Move to python instead of shell
    <li>Better scripts, ones that do not rely on a project path declared in the scripts
    <li>More features like server status, discord bot, etc...
    <li>Windows compatability
</ul>
The following features **MAY** be includeded in Kherimoya in the future
<ul>
<li>Extensions
<li>Custom API for plugins
</ul>

## setup

### NOTE: Kherimoya is NOT ready for use. I don't recommend using it until I make the scripts better.

### Linux instructions
1. Clone the repo
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chalupa-muntinlupa/kherimoya
    ```
2. Go in each script, and change the MARA_PATH= & PROJECT_PATH=. I don't remember what these variables mean, I think mara path is Kheremara's path?? But Kheremara shouldn't be installed

...And that's it! Please don't install this, it's not ready for actual use right now.
